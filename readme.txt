Remove 'OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA' from caption and title by image upload

== Description ==
Any photo taken on an Olympus camera is assigned an all-caps ‘OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA’ label in the caption ant title field of the metadata. This can be annoying because it’s not immediately evident that this is happening, but whenever you upload/post it on wordpress that surfaces this data, you’ll suddenly find it attached to your photo as the title and caption. This plugin replaces 'OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA' when uploading with the file name. Other metadata will be preserved. The title and caption tag will only be replaced if it contains 'OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA'. Other titles or captions will not be changed.
