#. Description of the plugin
msgid ""
"Any photo taken on an Olympus camera is assigned an all-caps ‘OLYMPUS "
"DIGITAL CAMERA’ label in the caption ant title field of the metadata. This "
"can be annoying because it’s not immediately evident that this is happening, "
"but whenever you upload/post it on wordpress that surfaces this data, you’ll "
"suddenly find it attached to your photo as the title and caption. This "
"plugin replaces 'OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA' when uploading with the file name. "
"Other metadata will be preserved. The title and caption tag will only be "
"replaced if it contains 'OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA'. Other titles or captions "
"will not be changed."
